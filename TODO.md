  * BUG:
    * change deploy_action to return package_object that was created for said action, not package_object that was used as template
    * work on deploy action & start_seconds_from_now (a new action gets created at actual start time)

  * GEN:
    * add custom name to deploy_action
    * add secondary loop for if any data == current result unavail/etc (MEDIUM)
    * Add method to get question progress (MEDIUM)
    * add print_user bin script (SMALL)
    * change get logic to use cache_filters instead of objectlist for object selection (HUGE)
    * fix search attrs for cmdline scripts (HUGE/CORRELATIVE)
    * add non id/name/hash search support to get_$object.py (HUGE/CORRELATIVE)
    * question filters get params too?? (UNKNOWN)

  * DOC:
    * add to cmd line help: export type & export options must be at end of cmd line
    * add console.wsdl to documentation via build script
    * winbin doc note re double quotes and using batch scripts instead of py scripts directly
    * add more doc notes/refs for dehumanize_*
    * explain get == select col data, from == select row data (SMALL/DOC)
    * add pointers to KB articles (SMALL/DOC)
    * add readme.md to examples (SMALL/DOC)
    * broken CR in folder name search regex match (SMALL) (limit in excel, 32k chars per cell)

  * TEST:
    * add validation results of testing against various platform versions for each release
    * add tests for SSE
    * rebuild zip_dists, and test on win
    * add approve action to pytan (need doc update and test update)
    * add unit tests for logout()
    * add unit tests for auth with session
    * add unit tests for sessions_lib
    * add tests for dashboard stuffs
    * cache_results test: If you are adding tests for that mechanism you could make tests that verify it returns an error if you specify a cache that has expired and make sure that the results that come back donâ€™t change.
    * test verify checks work against package with verification (unable to do) (UNKNOWN)
    * test against all the different levels of user privs (UNKNOWN)

  * PLATFORM:
    * open enhancement for console.wsdl to contain platform version

  * LOW:
    * re-work build API example scripts to be more better-er
    * update EXAMPLES to work with 2.0.0
    * look into update object methods (UNKNOWN)
    * logfile support (MEDIUM)
    * email out (MEDIUM)
    * add caching (HUGE)
    * figure out cert based auth/plugin based auth? (HUGE)
    * add os env overrides!
