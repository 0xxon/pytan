Ask manual human question sensor with filter
==========================================================================================
Ask a manual question using human strings by referencing the name of a single sensor.

Also supply a sensor filter that limits the column data that is shown to values that contain Windows (which is short hand for regex match against .*Windows.*).

No sensor parameters, sensor filter options, question filters or question options supplied.
